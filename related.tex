With the exploration on ABE from various aspects concluding efficiency, security and function,
the variety of ABE schemes have been growing.
However, there has been no integrated overview that contains not only various ABE schemes,
but also analysis of design philosophy.
Cheng-Chi Lee \emph{et al.} \cite{Lee:JNS'13} do the survey on ABE of access control,
but just enumerates the CP-ABE, KP-ABE, ABE scheme with Non-Monotonic Access Structures and so on,
so that we cannot obtain the clear relationship among those schemes from the paper.
Moreover, the significant LSSS and circuits do not be mentioned.
From the standpoint of difficulties in ABE,
Jin-Shu Su \emph{et al.} \cite{Su:JS'11} describe the access structure, attribute revocation, multi-authority scheme and so on.
Nevertheless, we cannot find the Non-Monotonic access Structure and circuits in the part of access structure from this article.
Besides, the ABE variants such as proxy re-encryption, outsource ABE are not concluded.
Deng-Guo Feng and Cheng Chen \cite{Feng:jcr'14} point out the direction of development on hot topics of ABE,
However, the survey on the most essential access policy is not embodied.
