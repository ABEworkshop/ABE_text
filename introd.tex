\section{Introduction}
Attribute-based encryption(ABE) play an important role in encryption scheme of cloud such us\cite{Li Ming:tpds},\cite{other:12},\cite{kp:11},\cite{policy:16},\cite{other:20} due to that ABE is not only powerful mechanism for protecting the confidentiality of stored and transmitted information inheriting traditional public-key encryption but also achieves the stride from one-to-one model from previous encryption to one-to-many\cite{cp:expressive},and specifically implementing access control and supporting storing in untrusted storage server are the reasons for its achieving.Additionally,ABE has following concrete advantages:\subsubsection{High Efficiency}:The cost of encryption and decryption is only related with the length of ciphertext and the number of attributes,and has nothing to do with the number of users;\subsubsection{Dynamic}:decryption can be completed by user only when the attributes satisfy the policy,and has nothing to do with the time when the user join this systems.\subsubsection{Flexibility}:ABE supports various access structure such us threshold policy and boolean format.\subsubsection{Privacy}:when data owner encrypt,he or she has no need to know the specific identities of individuals who will authorised decrypt\cite{Feng:survey}.

ABE is actually an extension of identified based encryption(IBE) and it can regard as a special IBE that multiply identities which meet a specific constraint can decrypt the ciphertext.In ABE,that constraint is just the access policy,and user can decrypt only when attributes satisfy the policy.For integrity,there is a simple division,which is only helpful on the application context and make little sense for the more heuristic research on ABE after it has formed,of ABE into ciphertext-policy attribute-Based encryption(CP-ABE) and key-policy attribute-Based encryption(KP-ABE).For CP-ABE,user keys are associated with sets of attributes,whereas ciphertexts are associated with policies,and for KP-ABE,the case is the contrary.

With the development of heuristic research on ABE,more and more ABE variants has been growing.However,there has been no integrated overview published that should not just concludes most of topics of ABE but also figure out the logical and clear clues or directions of development of ABE from pre-birth to now.\cite{IE:survey}does the survey on ABE of access control,%but CP-ABE,KP-ABE,ABE Scheme with Non-Monotonic Access Structures,and Hierarchical ABE are parallel status from the article structure,which means those kind of schemes belong to the same category in logic. 
but just enumerate CP-ABE,KP-ABE,ABE Scheme with Non-Monotonic Access Structures,and Hierarchical ABE so from this article we can't find out the relationship among those schemes.From the aspect of difficulties of ABE,\cite{Su:survey}
analyzes the access structure,attribute revocation,key-abuse problem and multi-authority scheme,but those issues contain all of that in ABE.\cite{Feng:survey} points out the direction of development on concrete topics of ABE,however there is also no clear hierarchy of ABE schemes.
