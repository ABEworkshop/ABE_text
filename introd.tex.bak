\section{Introduction}
Attributed based encryption(ABE) play an important role in encryption scheme of cloud such us\cite{Li Ming:tpds},\cite{other:12},\cite{kp:11},\cite{policy:16},\cite{other:20} due to that ABE is not only powerful mechanism for protecting the confidentiality of stored and transmitted information inheriting traditional public-key encryption but also achieves the stride from one-to-one model from previous encryption to one-to-many\cite{cp:expressive},and specifically implementing access control and supporting storing in untrusted storage server are the reasons for its achieving.Additionally,ABE has following concrete advantages:\subsubsection{High Efficiency}:The cost of encryption and decryption is only related with the length of ciphertext and the number of attributes,and has nothing to do with the number of users;\subsubsection{Dynamic}:decryption can be completed by user only when the attributes satisfy the policy,and has nothing to do with the time when the user join this systems.\subsubsection{Flexibility}:ABE supports various access structure such us threshold policy and boolean format.\subsubsection{Privacy}:when data owner encrypt,he or she has no need to know the specific identities of individuals who will authorised decrypt\cite{Feng:survey}.




Attributed based encryption(ABE) is a extension of identified based encryption 
Introduction goes here
main idea is why our paper is important.
should point out the advantage of ABE
and should give some research on the survey of ABE
