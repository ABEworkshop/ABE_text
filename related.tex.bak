With the exploration on ABE from aspects of efficiency, security and function, more and more ABE variants has been growing. However, there has been no integrated overview published that contains not only various ABE schemes, but also analysis of design  from pre-birth to now.\cite{IE:survey}does the survey on ABE of access control,but CP-ABE,KP-ABE,ABE Scheme with Non-Monotonic Access Structures,and Hierarchical ABE are parallel status from the article structure,which means those kind of schemes belong to the same category in logic.
but just enumerate CP-ABE,KP-ABE,ABE Scheme with Non-Monotonic Access Structures,and Hierarchical ABE so from this article we can't find out the relationship among those schemes.From the aspect of difficulties of ABE,\cite{Su:survey}
analyzes the access structure,attribute revocation,key-abuse problem and multi-authority scheme,but those issues don't contain all of that in ABE.\cite{Feng:survey} points out the direction of development on concrete topics of ABE,however there is also no clear hierarchy of ABE schemes.
