With the exploration on ABE from aspects of efficiency, security and function, 
more and more ABE variants has been growing. 
However, there has been no integrated overview published that contains not only various ABE schemes, 
but also analysis of design philosophy. 
\cite{IE:survey} does the survey on ABE of access control, 
but just enumerate CP-ABE, KP-ABE, ABE Scheme with Non-Monotonic Access Structures and so on, 
so that we cannot obtain the clear relationship among those schemes from the paper, 
and also Boolean formula of LSSS and circuit do not be mentioned.
From the standpoint of difficulties in ABE, 
\cite{Su:survey} describes the access structure, attribute revocation, key-abuse problem and multi-authority scheme, 
 but we cannot find the Non-Monotonic Access Structures and Boolean formula of circuit in the part of access structure from this article.
Besides, the ABE variants such as proxy re-encryption, outsource ABE are not concluded.  
\cite{Feng:survey} points out the direction of development on hot topics of ABE, 
However the survey on the most essential access policy is not embodied.
